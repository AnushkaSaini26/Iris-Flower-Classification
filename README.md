# Iris Flower Classification
This project classifies Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements using a Random Forest Classifier.

### Overview
The Iris flower classification project is a machine learning example that demonstrates the classification of Iris flowers into their respective species using scikit-learn's Random Forest Classifier. The dataset contains 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). Each sample has four features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**
